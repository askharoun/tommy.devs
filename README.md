Hey! I'm Thomas Askharoun and this is my first website EVER on the internet. It's made entirely out of HTML and CSS because I wanted to do a "final test" of my knowlage. I'm still learning HTML and CSS, I just wanted to know how much I could do with it. 

I'm a freshman in College as of 2024, check my about page on my website to see where I go :D
